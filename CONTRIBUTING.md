# Contributing to Nexus Data Tools

I'm always open to any contributions you may have. If you're looking to contribute but don't know what to do, there are some important ways you can help out:

### Testing & Reporting Bugs

I can't humanly test every scenario. Naturally, people (like you!) are going to find bugs. If you do find one, please [report it](/BellCubeDev/nexus-data-tools/issues/new) with as much detail as you can. If you can reproduce it, that's even better. If you can't reproduce it, that's okay tooâ€”report it anyway and we'll see what we can do.

### Translation

Nexus Data Tools is not accepting localization contributions at this time.

### Feature Requests & User Feedback

More ideas, more better! If you have a suggestion that you think might help make Nexus Data Tools more useful, [add an issue](/BellCubeDev/nexus-data-tools/issues/new) and I'll gladly take a look!

If you've found something confusing when working with one of the tools (or just want to say thanks), I'd love to hear from you! [Add an issue](/BellCubeDev/nexus-data-tools/issues/new) or [start a discussion](/BellCubeDev/nexus-data-tools/discussions/new) and let me know what you think!

### Direct Contributions (Styling, New Tools, etc.)

If you're familiar (or willing to get familiar) with the project structure and/or React and/or Next.js, you're always welcome to submit a pull request directly. I'll review it and see where it goes from there! Anything is fair game, especially if you want to address [an existing issue](/BellCubeDev/nexus-data-tools/issues)!
