A collection of tools for gathering, visualizing, and manipulating data from Nexus Mods

## Current Tools

#### Files by Hash
Calculate the hash for an arbitrary set of files on the client. Then, ask Nexus' API if it's seen those hashes and show any relevant data. Includes a set of rules to determine the most likely matches (since a file can be uploaded multiple times and MD5 may occasionally experience collisions)
